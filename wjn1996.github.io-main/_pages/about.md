- Hello! I am **Zhengyu Chen**.
- I am a Senior Researcher at [Meituan](https://www.meituan.com/en-US/about-us) in Beijing. I obtained the Ph.D degree from Zhejiang University in March 2023. In my Ph.D. study, I also spent wonderful internship time at <a href="https://tongyi.aliyun.com/" target="_blank"><img src='./images/tongyi.png' align="center" style='vertical-align: middle; width: 19px;'></a> [Qwen Team](https://qwen.ai/home), Alibaba Group.
- My research interests consist of **Large Language Models (LLMs), Reinforcement Learning (RL), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Information Retrieval**. I have published 60+ research papers at top-tier conferences and journals including ICLR, ACL, ICML, NeurIPS, KDD, AAAI, EMNLP, etc., with <a class='all_citation_badges' href="" target="_blank"></a> citations according to Google Scholar. My research focuses on LLM pre-training, post-training, reinforcement learning with model feedback, and reasoning. More details can be found in [Publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PqrvpbkAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PqrvpbkAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).
- **We are always actively recruiting highly motivated Full-Time Researcher and Research Interns! If interested, please contact me with your detailed CV!**
