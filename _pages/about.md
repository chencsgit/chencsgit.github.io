- Hello! I am **Zhengyu Chen**.
- I am a Senior Researcher at the **LongCat Team** of [Meituan](https://www.meituan.com/en-US/about-us) in Beijing. I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science & Technology from Zhejiang University in March 2023. During my Ph.D. studies, I also participated in the <a href="https://qwen.ai/" target="_blank">Qwen Team</a> (formerly the M6 team) at Alibaba DAMO Academy from 2021-2023.
- My research interests focus on **Large Language Models (LLMs), Reinforcement Learning (RL), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Trustworthy AI Systems**. I have published 60+ research papers at top-tier conferences and journals including ICLR, ACL, ICML, NeurIPS, KDD, CVPR, EMNLP, etc., with <a class='all_citation_badges' href="" target="_blank"></a> citations according to Google Scholar. More details can be found in [Publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PqrvpbkAAAAJ) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PqrvpbkAAAAJ).
- **We are always actively recruiting highly motivated Full-Time Researchers and Research Interns! If interested, please contact me with your detailed CV!**
